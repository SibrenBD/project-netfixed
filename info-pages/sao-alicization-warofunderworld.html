                            <p>"Where...am I...?" Before he knows it, Kirito has made a full-dive into an epic,
                                fantasy-like virtual world. With only a murky recollection of what happened right before
                                he logged in, he starts to wander around, searching for clues. He comes upon an
                                enormous, pitch dark tree (the Gigas Cedar), where he encounters a boy. "My name is
                                Eugeo. Nice to meet you, Kirito." Although he is supposedly a resident of the virtual
                                world – an NPC – the boy shows the same array of emotions as any human being. As Kirito
                                bonds with Eugeo, he continues to search for a way to log out of this world. Meanwhile,
                                he remembers a certain memory deep down within him. He remembers racing through the
                                mountains with Eugeo as a child... A memory that he should not have in the first place.
                                And in this memory, he sees someone other than Eugeo, a young blond girl. Her name is
                                Alice. And it is a name that must never be forgotten... (Source: Aniplex USA)</p><br>
