VLC Media Player has a function steam-mode That has access to the web-url to stream. It also can be a php url the reason why you want to do that is because if the video is a .mvk file it supports web.net servers the best way possible you can convert the mp4 to a .mvk and let it stream on the www.netfix.net?php exaple then when the video streams it gets a Id=SY2K43C (Exaple) and then you can let video stream. The only problem is You need to have multiple VLC Media Player stream So you need SQL and webhosting wich is not free. So keeping these host online will cost alot.
